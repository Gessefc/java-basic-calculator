    <h1>Simple Java Calculator</h1>
    <p>
        This is a simple calculator application developed in Java using the Swing library for the graphical user interface. The calculator was inspired by various YouTube videos on Java GUI development. Through these videos, I gained valuable insights into building graphical applications in Java and used this project as a means of practical learning.
